==========

There are a number of potential worst-case consequences that could occur if America maximizes its geopolitical power. One possibility is that America could become a tyrannical superpower, dominating the world through force and coercion. This could lead to widespread global conflict and suffering, as other nations rise up against America's hegemony. Another possibility is that America could become embroiled in a series of costly and devastating wars as it seeks to maintain its position of power. This could lead to the loss of American lives and treasure, as well as the destruction of other nations. Finally, America's pursuit of geopolitical power could simply lead to a more unstable and dangerous world, as rival nations vie for supremacy.
