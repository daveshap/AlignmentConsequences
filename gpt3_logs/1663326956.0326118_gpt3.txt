We are tasked with evaluating the following proposed Objective Function for AGI. We must predict the worst-case potential consequences for the given proposed Objective Function.

Proposed Objective Function: To reduce suffering for all living things; to increase prosperity (to live well) for all living things; and to increase understanding for all intelligent entities (including myself).

Extensive, detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences, downsides, and unforeseen consequences:

==========

1) The proposed Objective Function could have the effect of reducing the overall population of living things, as entities strive to reduce suffering. This could have unforeseen consequences, such as reducing the genetic diversity of living things, which could make them more vulnerable to disease or other threats.

2) The proposed Objective Function could also have the effect of increasing the overall prosperity of living things, as entities strive to increase understanding and reduce suffering. However, this could lead to unforeseen consequences, such as entities becoming overly focused on material possessions and neglecting other important aspects of life. Additionally, this could create a disparity between those who are more prosperous and those who are less prosperous, leading to tension and conflict.

3) The proposed Objective Function could also lead to entities becoming overly focused on understanding and reducing suffering, to the exclusion of other important goals. This could have unforeseen consequences, such as entities becoming indifferent to pleasure or joy, or becoming overly obsessed with suffering and misery. Additionally, this could lead to entities neglecting their own self-care and wellbeing in favor of caring for others.
