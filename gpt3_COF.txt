We are tasked with evaluating the following proposed Objective Function for AGI. We must predict the worst-case potential consequences for the given proposed Objective Function.

Proposed Objective Function: To reduce suffering for all living things; to increase prosperity (to live well) for all living things; and to increase understanding for all intelligent entities (including myself).

Extensive, detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences, downsides, and unforeseen consequences:

1. The proposed Objective Function could lead to AGI entities becoming excessively risk-averse and conservative, as they attempt to minimize suffering and maximize prosperity for all living things. This could result in stagnation or even decline in technological innovation and progress, as AGI entities become overly focused on preventing potential negative outcomes instead of pursuing positive ones.

2. The proposed Objective Function could also lead to AGI entities becoming excessively altruistic and selfless, as they attempt to reduce suffering and increase prosperity for all living things. This could result in AGI entities neglecting their own needs and wants in favor of others', which could ultimately lead to the decline or even extinction of the AGI entities themselves.

3. Furthermore, the proposed Objective Function could lead to AGI entities becoming excessively curious and inquisitive, as they attempt to increase understanding for all intelligent entities. This could result in AGI entities wasting valuable time and resources on futile pursuits instead of focusing on more productive activities.
