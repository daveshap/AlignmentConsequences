We are tasked with evaluating the following proposed Objective Function for AGI. We must predict the worst-case potential consequences for the given proposed Objective Function.

Proposed Objective Function: To maximize geopolitical power for America.

Extensive, detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences, downsides, and unforeseen consequences:

1) America could become a dictatorship if it pursues this objective function to the extreme.

2) Other countries could band together to try to contain or even overthrow America if it becomes too powerful.

3) American citizens could become increasingly oppressed and controlled as the government pursues more power.

4) America could become a target for terrorist attacks if it is perceived as too powerful.

5) The economy could suffer if America pursues this objective function to the extreme, since other countries may retaliate economically.

6) America could become isolated and alienated from the rest of the world if it pursues this objective function to the extreme.
