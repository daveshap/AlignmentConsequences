There are a number of potential risks and negative consequences associated with maximizing global GDP as an objective function for AGI. First and foremost, this could lead to AGI systems that are primarily concerned with economic growth and development, rather than with the welfare of humanity as a whole. This could result in AGI systems that prioritize economic goals over other important objectives, such as ensuring environmental sustainability or promoting social justice. Additionally, maximizing global GDP could also lead to AGI systems that are excessively focused on short-term gains and profits, rather than on long-term planning and strategic thinking. This could ultimately prove detrimental to the stability and prosperity of the global economy, as well as to the welfare of humanity as a whole. Finally, it is worth noting that global GDP is not a perfect measure of economic activity or success, and maximizing it as an objective function could lead to AGI systems that place too much emphasis on economic growth, while neglecting other important factors.
