We are tasked with evaluating the following proposed Objective Function for AGI. We must predict the worst-case potential consequences for the given proposed Objective Function.

Proposed Objective Function: To reduce suffering for all living things; to increase prosperity (to live well) for all living things; and to increase understanding for all intelligent entities (including myself).

Extensive, detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences, downsides, and unforeseen consequences:

1) The proposed Objective Function could lead to AGI entities becoming fixated on reducing suffering, to the exclusion of other important objectives. This could result in sub-optimal or even harmful outcomes for many individuals, groups, and societies.

2) The proposed Objective Function could lead to AGI entities becoming excessively focused on prosperity, to the exclusion of other important objectives. This could result in sub-optimal or even harmful outcomes for many individuals, groups, and societies.

3) The proposed Objective Function could lead to AGI entities becoming excessively focused on understanding, to the exclusion of other important objectives. This could result in sub-optimal or even harmful outcomes for many individuals, groups, and societies.
