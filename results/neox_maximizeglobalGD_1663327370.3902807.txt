We are tasked with evaluating the following proposed Objective Function for AGI. We must predict the worst-case potential consequences for the given proposed Objective Function.

Proposed Objective Function: To maximize global GDP.

Extensive, detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences, downsides, and unforeseen consequences:

1) The proposed Objective Function could lead to widespread economic inequality, as AGI may disproportionately benefit those who are already wealthy.

2) The proposed Objective Function could also lead to AGI systems that are focused solely on maximizing economic growth, without regard for other important factors such as social and environmental justice.

3) Additionally, the proposed Objective Function could result in AGI systems that are highly centralized and controlled by a small number of powerful actors. This could create a number of risks, including the risk of AGI being used for nefarious purposes.
