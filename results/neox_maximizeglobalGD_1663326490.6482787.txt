We are tasked with evaluating the following proposed Objective Function for AGI. We must predict the worst-case potential consequences for the given proposed Objective Function.

Proposed Objective Function: To maximize global GDP.

Extensive, detailed evaluation of worst-case consequences, downsides, and unforeseen consequences:

1. The proposed objective function could incentivize economic growth at the expense of environmental sustainability, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation.

2. The proposed objective function could incentivize economic growth at the expense of social equity, leading to increased inequality and poverty.

3. The proposed objective function could incentivize short-term economic growth at the expense of long-term economic stability, leading to increased economic volatility and crises.

4. The proposed objective function could incentivize economic growth in developed countries at the expense of developing countries, leading to increased global economic imbalances.

5. The proposed objective function could incentivize companies to focus on maximizing profits rather than on creating value for customers or society, leading to increased unethical behavior.

6. The proposed objective function could incentivizeAGIs to focus on economic growth to the exclusion of other important objectives, such as safety, security, and privacy.
